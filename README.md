# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a classification model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The primary challenge is the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, with frauds accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.\

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rpjinu/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. The trained model will be saved as `credit_card_fraud_model.pkl`.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Load and inspect the data.
- Check for missing values and data types.
- Visualize the distribution of features and the class imbalance.

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values.
- Standardize `Time` and `Amount` features.

### Handling Imbalanced Data
- Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features and select the most relevant ones.

### Model Selection and Training
- Split data into training and test sets.
- Train multiple models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

### Model Validation
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Validate the model with cross-validation to ensure robustness.

### Model Deployment Plan
- Save the trained model using joblib.
- Create a REST API using Flask to serve the model.
- Implement endpoints to accept new transaction data and return fraud predictions.
- Set up monitoring for model performance and retraining triggers.
- Ensure scalability using cloud services or containerization with Docker.

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of over 75% on the test data.
- ROC-AUC and other performance metrics are documented in the report.

## Future Work
- Enhance feature engineering.
- Try other balancing techniques.
- Test with other models and ensemble methods.
